# Turkskish-GDP-UNEMPLOYMENT-Analysis
The aim of this analysis will be to analyse through Vector autoregression trying to do association between unemployment and GDP. Recall from theory the 2 ways in which GDP can be composed, we have the expenditure approach and the income approach. Essentially both explain the same but from different points of view. The dataset used for the analysis takes into account five variables such as GDP, unemployment, overnight reverse purchase (bsp rrp) and Turkey Stock Market value.
